# Dagbani BERT and GPT Language Models
(Mini Project for School...)
This mini project focuses on building BERT and GPT language models for Dagbani, a language spoken mostly in Ghana. The goal is to develop natural language processing models that can understand and generate text in Dagbani.

## Overview

The project consists of two main components:
1. **BERT Language Model**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks. In this project, we will train a BERT model specifically tailored for Dagbani language understanding tasks.

2. **GPT Language Model**: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a powerful language generation model. We will train a GPT model to generate Dagbani text based on the learned patterns from a large dataset.


## Setup and Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/naafidasana/NativLang.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
